## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a> <br>

War was the first complete game that I developed by myself. The game was written in C++ using the NetBeans IDE. It is a simple console game with some awesome ASCII art thrown in to give it that nostalgic feel.  

This project was the culmination of Dr. Mark E. Lehr's  CSC/CIS 17c - Data Structures at Riverside City College. The project utilizes a variety of container classes, iterators, and algorithms.  

I utilized sequences containers such as a list, slist, and bit_vector.  
Associative containers such as sets, maps, and hash tables.  
And container adaptors such as stack, queue, and prioirty_queue.  

For iterators I used trivial, input, output, forward, bidirectional, and random access.  

Finally, a great variety of algorithms were used.  
Non-mutating algorithms: for_each, find, count, equal, search.  
Mutating algorithms: copy, swap, transform, replace, fill, remove, and random_Shuffle.  
Organization algorithms: sort, binary search, merge, inplace_merge, minimum, and maximum.

Microverse was created using Netbeans Apache NetBeans IDE 12.3
