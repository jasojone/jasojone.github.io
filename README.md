# JasonJonesthe.dev
Welcome to my first portfolio website. I hope you find it pleasantly easy to navigate. 

# About
Here you can find my blog, CV, portfolio, and a bit of information about me. 

# Status
Project is: Incomplete

# Acknowledgments 
This website uses the template from [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/)
Powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages.  
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository.  
This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV.  
You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Thank you for taking the time to look at the README.md. Have a wonderful day.
